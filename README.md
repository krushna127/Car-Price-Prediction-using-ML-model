# 🚗 Car Price Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of a car using Machine Learning techniques.  
The model analyzes features such as Brand, Year, Engine Size, Fuel Type, Transmission, Mileage, Condition, and Model to estimate the car price.

This project was developed as part of a Data Science Internship and demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML pipeline.

## ⚙ Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering (One-Hot Encoding)  
4. Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)  
5. Model Training:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Feature Importance Analysis  
8. Streamlit Web Application Deployment

## 📈 Model Performance

The models were evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

Due to weak correlations in the dataset, R² values were low. However, the complete ML pipeline was successfully implemented.
